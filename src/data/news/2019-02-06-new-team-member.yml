  As Auxano continues to grow, we are pleased to introduce you Jessica Hanon,
  who joined the team in June after graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in
  English from Western Washington University. She and her husband moved from
  Spokane due to her desire to enter the wealth management industry. Jessica is
  a member of the Office and Client Management teams. She provides exceptional
  office support and works to exceed clients’ expectations with prompt and
  responsive assistance. You’ll see Jessica at the front desk when you enter the
  Auxano office. She wants Auxano’s clients to know that she’s looking forward
  to meeting them and is here to serve them. 


  Outside of work, Jessica enjoys spending time with her family, and enjoying
  the beautiful Pacific Northwest with her husband Nick.
