body: "## Transcending Wealth. \n\n## Transforming Lives.®\n\n## \\-\tThe Auxano Advisors Tagline\n\n**Summary**\n\n**We think a powerful brand is an important part of any successful business because it is what creates a true north guiding point.  At Auxano, our brand is summarized in the phrase, Transcending Wealth, Transforming Lives.  While our work is about the numbers on your statement, that is only part of the story. We believe true success transcends traditional metrics to include important intangibles.  One role we play, especially in challenging times like these, is to share the conviction of our approach.  From the autumn market peak through the end of the year, the more defensive components of our portfolios performed well, helping to buffer volatility in an overall difficult environment.  In fact, by one measure, 2018 was one of the most difficult years in the last century.  Our market forecast for 2019 is the same as J.P. Morgan’s famous forecast: it will fluctuate.  Markets are difficult to predict.\n**\n\n**Powerful Brands**\n\nEach year, business valuation consultancy Brand Finance publishes a report on the world’s most powerful brands. Ranking companies based upon a formula which calculates the impact of brand on revenue results in a list of well-known names. The top five positions in the 2017 report were held by Lego, Google, Nike, Ferrari, and Visa.\n\nLego’s first place spot is fascinating. On one level, the company simply creates toys made from molded plastic.  The brand, however, is much deeper.  The name 'LEGO' is an abbreviation of the two Danish words \"leg godt,\" meaning \"play well.\" It’s not just the name; it is the company’s ideal. In fact, the mission, “to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow” illustrates how powerful the core of the brand really is (Figure 1). More specifically, Lego states, “Our ultimate purpose is to inspire and develop children to think creatively, reason systematically and release their potential to shape their own future - experiencing the endless human possibility.”  \n\n![](/uploads/figure-1.jpg)\n\nWe think a powerful brand is an important part of any successful business because it is what creates a true north reference point.  This kind of clarity is one important component to creating enduring brands.  The best brands are deeper than simply product or service.  The Lego vision states that their vision “is not just about products, it is about realizing the human possibility.” \n\nThe Auxano brand is carried in the phrase, “Transcending Wealth, Transforming Lives.”  While we are very proud of our service quality, we believe true success transcends the numbers in a report.  It is our aim to improve lives through the principled, diligent integration of advice and investing.  The hallmark of our approach is the relational nature of the work, where we walk alongside each client in their personal stewardship journey.  It is times like these where we are reminded that the relational connection is important.  One of our roles is to help bring perspective to market volatility, and to remind you that corrections and bear markets are normal (and cannot be predicted).   \n\n**2018 In Review\n**\n\nWhile we are pleased with our portfolio performance for 2018 relative to global markets, the fact remains that it was one of the most challenging years in history. The scope of negative returns across global stock, bond and commodity markets has been quite unusual.  According to Deutsche Bank, in any single year, 29% of markets finish a year with losses, on average.  By late December, already 93% of the global financial asset classes tracked by Deutsche Bank were negative for the year, marking 2018 as one of the worst in over 100 years (Figure 2).  \n\n![](/uploads/figure-2.jpg)\n\nTo be sure, this was a difficult year for asset allocation and global investing. An equally weighted portfolio across stocks, bonds and commodities would have lost 8.4% for the year (Figure 3).  The average drawdown (the percentage off of the high for the year) across 45 global equity markets for 2018 was -24% (Figure 4).\n\n![](/uploads/figure-3.jpg)\n\n![](/uploads/figure-4.jpg)\n\nClearly this has been a difficult year across the capital allocation spectrum.  The good news is that while we don’t believe in market timing, we do believe in risk management.  To be clear, this means we attempt to carefully balance opportunity and risk when crafting your portfolio.  It does not mean that we can magically avoid portfolio volatility.  The only way to do that is with cash in the bank (or under your mattress), which eliminates volatility but ensures the long-term silent theft of purchasing power through inflation.  Our approach to risk management includes all weather portfolio construction, or the idea that if we have building blocks that do well in a bull market as well as others that provide some protection or relief during bear markets, then we should minimize overall portfolio risk.  In 2018, we are grateful to see our more defensive allocations performing better than global markets, especially in the more recent drawdown period.\n\n**Our Forecast** \n\nWhen J.P. Morgan was asked decades ago what his forecast for the stock market was, he famously answered, “it will fluctuate.”  That, too, is our forecast.  Our commitment is to remain invested with a multi-asset, globally diversified portfolio. Our true north is straightforward: we offer the integration of principled advice and investing to help you make more predictable and sound financial decisions.\n\n**Auxano News\n**\n\nYou've likely noticed that the design and style of the website are different than usual.
