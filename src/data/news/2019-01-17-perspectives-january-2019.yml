body: "# jjjTranscending Wealth. Transforming Lives.®\n\n# \\-\tThe Auxano Advisors Tagline\n\n## Summary\n\n**We think a powerful brand is an important part of any successful business because it is what creates a true north guiding point.  At Auxano, our brand is summarized in the phrase, Transcending Wealth, Transforming Lives.  While our work is about the numbers on your statement, that is only part of the story. We believe true success transcends traditional metrics to include important intangibles.  One role we play, especially in challenging times like these, is to share the conviction of our approach.  From the autumn market peak through the end of the year, the more defensive components of our portfolios performed well, helping to buffer volatility in an overall difficult environment.  In fact, by one measure, 2018 was one of the most difficult years in the last century.  Our market forecast for 2019 is the same as J.P. Morgan’s famous forecast: it will fluctuate.  Markets are difficult to predict.\n**\n\n## \\*\\*Powerful Brands\n\n\\*\\*\n\nEach year, business valuation consultancy Brand Finance publishes a report on the world’s most powerful brands. Ranking companies based upon a formula which calculates the impact of brand on revenue results in a list of well-known names. The top five positions in the 2017 report were held by Lego, Google, Nike, Ferrari, and Visa.\n\nLego’s first place spot is fascinating. On one level, the company simply creates toys made from molded plastic.  The brand, however, is much deeper.  The name 'LEGO' is an abbreviation of the two Danish words \"leg godt,\" meaning \"play well.\" It’s not just the name; it is the company’s ideal. In fact, the mission, “to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow” illustrates how powerful the core of the brand really is (Figure 1). More specifically, Lego states, “Our ultimate purpose is to inspire and develop children to think creatively, reason systematically and release their potential to shape their own future - experiencing the endless human possibility.”  \n\n![](/uploads/figure-1.jpg)\n\n- - -"
