  We are pleased to introduce you to our newest team member, Dan Anderson. We
  are thrilled to have Dan as a part of our growing team.


  Dan joined the team in July, after years of experience working with high net
  worth clients in the home appraisal field. Due to his love of math and
  analytics, and his passion for client satisfaction, moving to the wealth
  management field ultimately made sense to him. He’s eager to be putting his
  business degree to use and is inspired to put the time and effort into growing
  his abilities and seeing results.


  Dan is a self-proclaimed romantic who enjoys reading and playing his guitar.
  If you were to ask him what you should do in the Seattle area, it’s to take a
  hike to Silver Creek with friends.


  But if you call into Auxano and he happens to answer, say hello. Dan is
  quickly making a reputation for himself as a kind and competent team member.
  We’re so glad he’s here.
