    Providing a meaningful financial legacy for your family is a significant objective for Auxano. And while most competent investment firms can advise on generational wealth transfer strategies, they don't bring a new perspective on wealth; a perspective based on the premise that stewardship skills are essential for effective wealth transfers.


    Auxano employs a values-based methodology where vision drives decision. In other words, we'll help you shape a clear, coherent and actionable family vision that will inspire stewardship and provide for future family needs.


    More importantly, we'll emphasize the values and skills necessary to perpetuate your family vision so your children will grasp the broader paradigms of true wealth.


    We appreciate the fact that transfers of wealth can be a complex and emotional undertaking. It's delicate balance between bequeathing to the philanthropic purposes and people you care about the most, and retaining wealth to meet your needs. We bring knowledge and empathy to the process, but we also bring a passion for this job because we see every day the beneficial, life-changing upsides of wealth.

    heading: "These are a few of the many tools we use to help you through the process:"
    list: 
      - Determining your gifting capacity. We use an analytical model that factors in your horizon, risk tolerance and wishes, and then establish a baseline for wealth transfer.
      - Deciding on the best transfer strategies. Basic strategies, such as the annual exclusion and lifetime gift taxes, are combined with an arsenal of more complex solutions to find the one integrated solution that creates a unique, powerful and strategic approach. 
      - Revisiting the family vision and transfer strategies. Any plan must be adaptable as the tax codes, grantor's situation and capital markets are constantly evolving. 
  closing: All these pieces together—values, skills and legacy statement—produce the core of our approach, which is wealth with a vision, wealth with a purpose.
