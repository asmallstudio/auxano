    All these pieces together—values, skills and legacy statement—produce the
    core of our approach, which is wealth with a vision, wealth with a purpose.

    Providing a meaningful financial legacy for your family is a significant
    objective for Auxano. And while most competent investment firms can advise
    on generational wealth transfer strategies, they don't bring a new
    perspective on wealth; a perspective based on the premise that stewardship
    skills are essential for effective wealth transfers.

        Determining your gifting capacity. We use an analytical model that
        factors in your horizon, risk tolerance and wishes, and then establish a
        baseline for wealth transfer.

        Deciding on the best transfer strategies. Basic strategies, such as the
        annual exclusion and lifetime gift taxes, are combined with an arsenal
        of more complex solutions to find the one integrated solution that
        creates a unique, powerful and strategic approach.

        Revisiting the family vision and transfer strategies. Any plan must be
        adaptable as the tax codes, grantor's situation and capital markets are
        constantly evolving.
