    Ready to change your perspective? Let Auxano help create a strategy that brings together financial legacies and life goals into one integrated view. 
  title: Generations
body: >-
  Providing a meaningful financial legacy for your family is a significant objective for Auxano. And while most competent investment firms can advise on generational wealth transfer strategies, they don't bring a new perspective on wealth; a perspective based on the premise that stewardship skills are essential for effective wealth transfers.


  Auxano employs a values-based methodology where vision drives decision. In other words, we'll help you shape a clear, coherent and actionable family vision that will inspire stewardship and provide for future family needs.


  More importantly, we'll emphasize the values and skills necessary to perpetuate your family vision so your children will grasp the broader paradigms of true wealth.


  We appreciate the fact that transfers of wealth can be a complex and emotional undertaking. It's delicate balance between bequeathing to the philanthropic purposes and people you care about the most, and retaining wealth to meet your needs. We bring knowledge and empathy to the process, but we also bring a passion for this job because we see every day the beneficial, life-changing upsides of wealth.
