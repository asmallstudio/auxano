    An estate planning attorney crafts estate planning documents. They often include a will, an Advanced Medical Directive or living will, and a Power of Attorney. If your estate is complex, the attorney may also prepare trust documents. An excellent estate planning attorney is worth their fee because they craft personalized estate planning documents. The services beyond preparing estate documents vary by estate planning attorney, but usually do not include implementation.

    It begins with recognizing a need for estate planning and helping you determine what you want in advance of an estate attorneyâ€™s hourly rate. That might include a net worth statement, charitable intentions, and to whom and how you want to leave your assets. This process will work toward ensuring that your estate plan is implemented properly, including appropriate beneficiary designations for your IRAs.
