    Estate planning offers an actionable way to direct your affairs when you are
    no longer able to do so on your own. Instead of having decisions made by the
    State or by individuals who may not represent your interests, creating an
    intentional plan empowers those you trust to advance your wishes effectively
    and efficiently. By integrating your estate plan with your financial plan,
    you can seamlessly transition from a life of stewardship to a lasting
    legacy.
