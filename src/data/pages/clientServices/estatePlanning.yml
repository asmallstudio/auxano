    An estate planning attorney crafts estate planning documents. They often
    include a will, an advanced medical directive (sometimes called a living
    will), and a power of attorney. If your estate is complex, they may also
    prepare trust documents. An excellent estate planning attorney is worth
    their fee because they craft personalized estate planning documents. The
    services beyond preparing estate documents vary by estate planning attorney,
    but usually do not include implementation.

      It begins with recognizing a need for estate planning and helping you
      determine what you want in advance of an estate attorneyâ€™s hourly rate.
      That might include a net worth statement, charitable intentions, and to
      whom and how you want to leave your assets. This process will work toward
      ensuring that your estate plan is implemented properly, including
      appropriate beneficiary designations for your IRAs.

    Estate documents are important, but without the appropriate decision-making
    process and implementation, you can be exposed to unnecessary risks.
