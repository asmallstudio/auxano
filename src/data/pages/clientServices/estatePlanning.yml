    An estate planning attorney crafts estate planning documents. They often
    include a will, an advanced medical directive or living will, and a power of
    attorney. If your estate is complex, the attorney may also prepare trust
    documents. An excellent estate planning attorney is worth their fee because
    they craft personalized estate planning documents. The services beyond
    preparing estate documents vary by estate planning attorney, but usually do
    not include implementation.
