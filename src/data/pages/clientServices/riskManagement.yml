  As a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA), Auxano is committed to act in your
  best interest as a fiduciary. Our goal is not to sell insurance products, but
  to identify potential risks in advance, analyze them, and then take steps to
  reduce those risks. That may involve insurance products for a period of time,
  but the ultimate goal may be to grow your investments to the point where you
  don’t need that insurance. Insurance products are sometimes the best course of
  action, but only an integrated approach to financial planning can determine
  which risks to avoid, which risks are mitigating, which risks to insure, and
  which risks are self-insuring.
