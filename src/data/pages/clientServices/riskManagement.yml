  description: As a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA), Auxano is committed to act in your best interest as a fiduciary. Our goal is not to sell insurance products, but to identify potential risks in advance, analyze them, and then take steps to reduce those risks.
pullquote: "That may involve insurance products for a period of time, but the ultimate goal may be to grow your investments to the point where you don’t need that insurance."
