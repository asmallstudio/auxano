  description1: "What separates speculators and investors are the principles which undergird the decision-making process."
  description2: "Speculators allocate to an idea based upon a theory, set of beliefs or a story. Investors, in contrast, allocate capital based upon the prudent application of principles with respect to evidence."
  description3: |-
    In both cases risk is present. For the speculator, risk represents a gamble. For the investor, risk represents a hurdle that may be offset or mitigated by a margin of safety. The contrast between these two is stark.
    
    When wealth planning takes on speculative elements such as a now focus, a goal of living beyond one’s means, a debt-based view of consumption, you have risk-seeking behavior. We believe planning should be patient, focus on stewardship of current resources, and emphasize debt-reduction. 
    
    In the wealth management world, when speculative planning and capital allocation are combined, you have the multiplication of risk. At Auxano, we strive to integrate principled advice and investing in such a way that risk is managed, and probabilities of success are enhanced.
pullquote2: "Our approach centers on the integration of principles planning and investing. We believe this is True Wealth Management and is what Transcending Wealth, Transforming lives means to us."
