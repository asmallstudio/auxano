  “Successful investing is about managing risk, not avoiding it.” — **Benjamin
  Graham**, _The Intelligent Investor_

  description: >-
    Speculators allocate to an idea based upon a theory, set of beliefs or a
    story. Investors, in contrast, allocate capital based upon the prudent
    application of principles with respect to evidence.


    In both cases risk is present.  For the speculator, risk represents a
    gamble.  For the investor, risk represents a hurdle that may be offset or
    mitigated by a margin of safety.  The contrast between these two is stark.


    Wealth planning that takes on speculative elements can easily lead to
    risk-seeking behavior.  We believe planning should be patient, focus on
    stewardship of current resources, and emphasize debt-reduction.


    In the wealth management world, when speculative planning and capital
    allocation are combined, you have the multiplication of risk. At Auxano, we
    strive to integrate principled advice and investing in such a way that risk
    is managed and probabilities of success are enhanced.

    What separates speculators and investors are the principles which undergird
    their decision-making process.
