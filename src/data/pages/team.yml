      Blue Kayak Partners, founded by Jon Pinkston, provides non-discretionary
      investment research to Auxano Advisors in areas such as asset allocation,
      manager review, and macro analysis. Blue Kayak’s approach is based on the
      philosophy that because global capital markets are inefficient, and prices
      do not always reflect fair value, excess returns can be generated.
      Investor psychology — particularly overconfidence, pride and the tendency
      to avoid regret — explains not only the oscillation between fear and greed
      but also the propensity to avoid value stocks, to sell winners too early,
      and to hold onto losing positions. Simply put, investors often under- or
      overreact to new information. Blue Kayak believes that an intelligent
      combination of quantitative measures and informed judgment may provide
      opportunity for achieving superior investor returns through a systematic
      discipline to engage the periodic irrationality of markets.
