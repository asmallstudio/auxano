She and her husband moved from Spokane due to her desire to enter the wealth management industry. Jessica is a member of the Office and Client Management teams. She provides exceptional office support and works to exceed clients’ expectations with prompt and responsive assistance. You’ll see Jessica at the front desk when you enter the Auxano office. She wants Auxano’s clients to know that she’s looking forward to meeting them and is here to serve them.\n\nOutside of work, Jessica enjoys spending time with her family, and enjoying the beautiful Pacific Northwest with her husband Nick.\n\n![](/uploads/Jessica.jpg)"
